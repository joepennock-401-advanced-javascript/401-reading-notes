## Review, Research and Discussion:

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms).

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

## Vocabulary:

* `Router Middleware` -
